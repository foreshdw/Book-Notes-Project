# Book-Notes-Project
This is my book notes app project using the Express/Node.js platform with the pg library for PostgreSQL database management and the Axios HTTP client to integrate the Open Library Covers API for fetching book covers. The app allows users to log, review, and manage books they have read with sorting features based on rating, recency, and title.
