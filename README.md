# Book-Notes-Project
This is my book notes app project using the Express/Node.js platform with the pg library for PostgreSQL database management and the Axios HTTP client to integrate the Open Library Covers API for fetching book covers. The app allows users to log, review, and manage books they have read with sorting features based on rating, recency, and title. The frontend is styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive user interface.

## üöÄ Features

- Add, edit, and delete book notes
- Store book cover images
- Rate books you've read
- Sort notes by rating, recency, or title
